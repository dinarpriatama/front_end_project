                <h2>What is Front End Developer <i class="bi bi-patch-question"></i></h2>
                    <p>
                        A frontend developer is a professional who uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        to design and build the visual and interactive elements of websites and 
                        applications that users engage with directly. They ensure the interface 
                        is responsive, accessible, and visually appealing. Every feature you see 
                        and interact with on a website (like buttons, menus, and animations) is 
                        created by a frontend developer.
                    </p>

                <h2>What is the role of a Frontend Developer <i class="bi bi-patch-question"></i></h2>
                    <p>
                        While this is not a complete frontend developer job description, 
                        the following can be considered as a great introduction to the role 
                        of a frontend developer: you'll be responsible for creating the user 
                        interface of a website to ensure it looks good and is easy to use, 
                        with great focus on design principles and user experience. 
                        You'll be working closely with designers, back-end developers, 
                        and project managers to make sure the final product meets the 
                        client's needs and provides the best possible experience for the end-users.

                <h2>Which languages are used for Frontend Development <i class="bi bi-patch-question"></i></h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>HTML:</b> The markup language used to create the skeleton of the page. 
                        All the information you want to show on a webpage will be laid out through HTML.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>CSS:</b> The Cascading Style Sheet language allows you to adjust the way in 
                        which the HTML elements are rendered, improving the visuals of your webpage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Javascript:</b> This is the de facto programming language for frontend development, 
                        and it allows you to add dynamism to your websites/web apps. There is an alternative 
                        known as TypeScript, which is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that you can use instead. 
                        However, in that scenario, you'd have to set up a transpiler to translate your code into JavaScript 
                        before being able to run it in the browser.
